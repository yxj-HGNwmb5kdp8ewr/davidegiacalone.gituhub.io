excerpt: 'Napping® is an inexpensive and rapid method for sensory characterization, suitable for both trained and untrained subjects. In the study presented, the method was applied on 9 specialty beers. Subjects were 17 consumers without any training as sensory panelists, of whom 8 were beer experts and 9 novices. The aim was to explore the usability of the Napping® method by untrained consumers and to analyze differences between beer novices and experts in their ability to discriminate and describe the products. The method succeeded in discriminating between the beers, revealing sensory descriptors responsible for the differences. Analysis of differences between the two groups showed that the experts had higher agreement with regard to sample differences (significantly higher mean RV-coefficient, 0.61 vs. 0.41 for non-experts, p = 0.013). The results support the usability of Napping® as a fast method for sensory characterization, with the advantage of providing a product characterization based on consumer descriptions, thus better reflecting consumers' experience with the product.'
