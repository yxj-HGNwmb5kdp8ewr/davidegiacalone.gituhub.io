collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'This paper discusses the application of Partial Least Squares regression (PLS) to handle sensory data from check-all-that-apply (CATA) questions in a rapid, statistically reliable, and graphically-efficient way. We start by discussing the theory behind the CATA data and how these normally are analysed by multivariate techniques. CATA data can be analysed both by setting the CATA as the X and the Y. The former is the PLS-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) version, while the latter is the ANOVA-PLS (A-PLS) version.'
