Hi! I am Davide, a [sensory and consumer scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_analysis) and an Associate Professor at the Section for [Innovation and Design Engineering](https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/sduinnovationanddesignengineering), Dept. of Technology and Innovation, at the University of Southern Denmark ([SDU](https://www.sdu.dk/en)). 

My main interest and long-term goal as a scientist is to understand how consumers experience and behave towards food and beverages, and to apply this knowledge to the design of healthy and sustainable foods of the future. At SDU, I established and lead the [Sustainable Food Innovation](https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/sduinnovationanddesignengineering/researchareas/sustainablefoodinnovation) research group (currently composed of four full-time members plus one part-time affiliated researcher) which focuses on sensory and consumer science with applications in food product development and optimization. 

Research in my group addresses societal challenges related to eating and drinking, and is closely related to ongoing Danish and European programs on health and sustainability, such as the EU Farm to Fork strategy and the Danish Gr√∏n Omstilling. As an example, recent and ongoing projects have focused on identifying barriers to consumption of plant-based foods and beverages, working with converting side streams from meat and dairy processing into value-added products, and improving the nutritional content of food products targeted at vulnerable consumers.

Nothing too fancy as I have just started dabbling in html and markdown :). Right now you can information on my [research](/_pages/research.md) and [teaching activities](/_pages/teaching.md). You can also read and download [my full cv](/_pages/cv.md) and most of my [publications](/_pages/publications.md).
