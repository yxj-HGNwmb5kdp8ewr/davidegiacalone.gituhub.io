excerpt: 'The aging of the world population is accelerating. To meet the food and nutritional needs of the expanding aging population, it is necessary for both food researchers and food industry to obtain a good understanding of how aging affects orosensory perceptions. There is a need for potential strategies to counteract these adverse effects on food preferences in order to maintain food appetite in old age. This review paper has two main objectives: 1) to review evidence and causes of orosensory changes with aging and to indicate influences of age-related orosensory changes on elderly’s food preferences; 2) to summarize the effects of compensatory strategies (e.g., flavor and texture modifications) for counteracting age-related orosensory changes...'
