excerpt: 'Rapid sensory methods are a convenient alternative to conventional descriptive analysis suitable for quickly assessing sensory product differences. As these methods gain in popularity, assessments of their discriminability and reproducibility in food applications are increasingly needed. Moreover, it is of interest to explore whether small adjustments to the existing protocols could improve the results. In this study different variations of two rapid sensory methods, one based on holistic assessment – Napping, and one based on attribute evaluation – Flash Profile, were tested for the evaluation of the flavour in wine...'
