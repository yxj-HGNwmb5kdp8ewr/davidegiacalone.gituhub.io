Hi and welcome to this website! 

I am Davide, a [sensory and consumer scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_analysis) and an Associate Professor at the Section for [Innovation and Design Engineering](https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/sduinnovationanddesignengineering), Dept. of Technology and Innovation, at the University of Southern Denmark ([SDU](https://www.sdu.dk/en)). 

As a sensory scientist, I am interested in consumersâ€™ perceptions and behavior towards food and beverages (and occasionally other consumer products). My long-term goal is to understand how consumers experience and behave towards food and beverages, and to apply this knowledge to the design of healthy and sustainable foods of the future. At SDU, I established and lead the [Sustainable Food Innovation](https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/sduinnovationanddesignengineering/researchareas/sustainablefoodinnovation) research group (currently composed of four full-time members plus one part-time affiliated researcher) which focuses on sensory and consumer science with applications in food product development and optimization.
