excerpt: 'Rate-all-that-apply (RATA) is a variant of check-all-that-apply (CATA) questions that allows assessor to rate the intensity of selected attributes. Compared to CATA, RATA has the potential to improve sample description and discrimination, and might be more useful when only a small number of assessors are available. Before advocating its use with confidence, investigations on the method validity and reproducibility are necessary. Within this context, this short paper examined the reproducibility of results obtained by RATA within a testâ€“retest paradigm, drawing on data from a case study involving sensory assessment of common defects in chocolate production...'
