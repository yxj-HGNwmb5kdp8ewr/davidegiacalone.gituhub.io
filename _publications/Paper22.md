collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2017-01-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: This is the second of a series of papers evaluating the efficiency of rapid sensory profiling methodologies in the audio field. The present paper introduces projective mapping as a method for perceptual audio evaluation and demonstrates its application for discrimination and description of a set of high-end loudspeakers. Additionally, the suitability of the method with both experts and naïve assessors was evaluated...'
