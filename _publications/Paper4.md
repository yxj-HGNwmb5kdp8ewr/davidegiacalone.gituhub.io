excerpt: 'The present study compares three profiling methods based on consumer perceptions in their ability to discriminate and describe eight beers. Consumers (n = 135) evaluated eight different beers using Check-All-That-Apply (CATA) methodology in two variations, with (n = 63) and without (n = 73) rating the intensity of the checked descriptors. With CATA, consumers rated 38 descriptors grouped in seven overall categories (berries, floral, hoppy, nutty, roasted, spicy/herbal and woody). Additionally 40 of the consumers evaluated the same samples by partial Napping® followed by Ultra Flash Profiling (UFP). ANOVA- and Discriminant Partial Least Square Regression (A-PLSR, D-PLSR) were used to evaluate the discriminative ability of the methods and descriptors. A-PLSR results showed that all samples were perceived as different in all three methods, whereas...'
