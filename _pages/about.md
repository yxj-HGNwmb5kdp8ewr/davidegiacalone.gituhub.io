Hi! I am Davide, a [sensory and consumer scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_analysis) and an Associate Professor at the Section for [Innovation and Design Engineering](https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/sduinnovationanddesignengineering), Dept. of Technology and Innovation, at the University of Southern Denmark ([SDU](https://www.sdu.dk/en)). 

My main interest and long-term goal as a scientist is to understand how consumers experience and behave towards food and beverages, and to apply this knowledge to the design of healthy and sustainable foods of the future. At SDU, I established and lead the [Sustainable Food Innovation](https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/sduinnovationanddesignengineering/researchareas/sustainablefoodinnovation) research group (currently composed of four full-time members plus one part-time affiliated researcher) which focuses on sensory and consumer science with applications in food product development and optimization. Research in my group is closely related to ongoing Danish and European programs on health and sustainability, such as the EU Farm to Fork strategy and the Danish Grøn Omstilling. As an example, recent and ongoing projects have focused on reducing households’ food waste, improving intake of fruit and vegetables, identifying barriers to consumption of plant-based foods and beverages, working with converting side streams from meat and dairy processing into value-added products, and improving the nutritional content of food products targeted at vulnerable consumers. 

My work and research
======
My field of research is sensory and consumer science, that is, the study of human perception of food and other consumer products. It is a highly interdisciplinary field that combines food analysis, experimental psychology, physiology, behavioral science and statistics. 

This interdisciplinarity is a challenge but it makes sensory and consumer science highly relevant to tackle real-world industrial problems (e.g., which charcteristics should a product has in order to be succesful in the market) and tackling societal challenges (e.g., how can we more eating habits in a more sustainable direction). My research work in this field follows three main streams:

### 1. How to measure consumer responses to products (and with whom)
This research stream includes applied and fundamental work on product characterization with both consumers and expert panels. When I started out, there was a strong belief in the field that only highly trained experts could give valid information about products, and that consumers else could only tell you whether they like or dislike something. My research has contributed, together with that of others, towards a shift towards a more nuanced view on human capabilities for sensory evaluation, and to understand how untrained and semi-trained assessors can generate valuable data, provided that the methods are fine-tuned accordingly. I am especially interested in methodological work to develop best-practices in applied product testing, in order to fit different situations and different types of assessors. 

### 2. Relating perceptual measurements to consumer behavior
One of my long-term research goals is to understand how perceptual responses to products collected during product tests with consumers predict actual behavior. This is a long-standing issue with many practical consequences – for example, in commercial R&D it is well known that a large fraction (75-90%) of new foods and beverages introduced in the market fails within one year of lunch. There are, of course many reasons for this but some of them have to do with the way products are tested with consumers. Two issues that are in my opinion critical are a single reliance on a specific product performance metric (e.g., product liking) and a disregard for the context in which the consumers experience food products. I have worked extensively on addressing these issues by working with a wide variety of perceptual measures and situational aspects of product perception. One of my pet peeves regarding the sensory and consumer field is that when designing product tests the focus is generally on internal validity (i.e., having tight control over the experiment in order to have high quality data) rather than external validity (i.e. collecting data that *actually* predict consumer behavior). Currently I am particularly interested in benchmarking perceptual measures obtained in product test against real-world performance data such as choices, dietary recalls, sales volumes, etc. This is difficult to do in practise but it is absolutely essentially to do sensory work that actually matters and doing so generally produces eye-opening insights.

### 3. Individual differences in sensory perception and preferences towards food and beverages.

My background and history
======
My background is highly interdisciplinary and combines social science, natural science, and engineering. I originally trained in political science and economics in Italy (LUISS University in Rome) and Denmark (University of Southern Denmark in Odense), then went on to doing a PhD in Food Science at the University of Copenhagen on consumer preferences for craft beers, followed by a postdoc on developing protein-enriched in vulnerable demographics. I then moved "back" to SDU in 2015, this time to an industrial engineering department focusing on user experiences of both food (mainly) and non-food products (e.g. audio and textiles). My education and employments have given me a diverse set of competences as well as a broad network of diverse collaborators that I am able to draw on in my work. 

On the personal side, I am originally Italian but moved to Denmark in the now far 2004. I live in Copenhagen with my partner Christine and our son Marco.
