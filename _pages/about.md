Hi and welcome to this website! I am Davide Giacalone, I am a [sensory and consumer scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_analysis) and currently work as an Associate Professor at the Section for Innovation and Design Engineering, Dept. of Technology and Innovation, at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). Within the section, I established and lead the sustainable food innovation research group (currently composed of four full-time members plus one part-time affiliated researcher) which focuses on sensory and consumer science with applications in food product development and optimization. As a sensory scientist, I am interested in consumersâ€™ perceptions and behavior towards food and beverages (and occasionally other consumer products). My long-term goal is to understand how consumers experience and behave towards food and beverages, and to apply this knowledge to the design of healthy and sustainable foods of the future.
